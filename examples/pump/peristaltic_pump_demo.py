"""A module for controlling peristaltic pumps using the Aqueduct framework.

This demo program initializes a PeristalticPump device, sets the pump to run 
continuously at a specific flow rate, and then reverses the direction of the 
pump's rotation after a certain amount of time has passed. The program continuously 
checks the flow rate of the pump and sends new start commands to reverse 
the direction if the flow rate reaches 0.
